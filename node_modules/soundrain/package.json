Based on the awesome work by [@dmotz](https://github.com/dmotz/soundscrape).\n\nThis Node.js module isn't connected to the [soundrain.org](http://soundrain.org/) website, it was solely created for my personal use - but figured since I'm awesome, I'll share it.\n\n# Installation\n`npm install soundrain`\n\n# Usage\nSoundRain is really easy to setup. Create a folder in your app directory which will be used to download songs into. In this example, I've used `./mp3`.\n\n```js\nSoundRain = require('soundrain');\nvar Song = new SoundRain(\"https://soundcloud.com/jbrooksuk/twisted-beat-sample-at\", './mp3');\nSong.on('error', function(err) {\n\tif(err) throw err;\n}).on('done', function(file) {\n\tconsole.log(file);\n});\n```\n\n# Notice\nUse responsibly and respect SoundCloud and the artists which use it.\n\n# License\nMIT - [http://jbrooksuk.mit-license.org](http://jbrooksuk.mit-license.org)",
